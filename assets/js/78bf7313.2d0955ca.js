The backend also uses ChatGPT for prioritizing tasks and gamifying the user\'s experience. A SQL database stores and retrieves user-related data, such as avatar details and progress, supporting both data storage and display functionalities in the system.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"requirements/system-overview":{"id":"requirements/system-overview","title":"System Overview","description":"Canvas Quest will streamline the assignment process and enhance student engagement through gamification of coursework.
