The main goal is to be more immersive and deepen engagement while maintaining a focus on academic productivity. Instead of simple lists, each assignment could be part of an evolving quest where the student can freely move around the map and talk to an NPC to start an assignment. Users will earn gold upon completion of tasks and they will contribute to building up the map. Students can earn customizable gear that directly influences their avatar\u2019s strength in the game. The state of their map and inventory can be tied directly to long-term academic growth, encouraging students to not only complete tasks but also reflect on their learning progress. Ultimately, the Study RPG Game Organizer app offers a more immersive, engaging, and adaptive experience than Habitica, deeply integrating academic tasks with RPG gameplay for long-term motivation and productivity.\n."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,i.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(c,{...e})}):c(e)}},28453:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{R:()=>r,x:()=>o});var a=n(96540);const i={},s=a.createContext(i);function r(e){const t=a.useContext(s);return a.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function o(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:r(e.components),a.createElement(s.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
